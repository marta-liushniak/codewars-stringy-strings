Write a function stringy that takes a size and returns a string of alternating '1s' and '0s'.
The string should start with a 1.

A string with size 6 should return : **'101010'**, with size 4 should return : **'1010'**, with size 12 should return : **'101010101010'**, etc.

The size will always be positive and will only use whole numbers.
